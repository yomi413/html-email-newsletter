## The Project

In this first project for Moms Can Code School we were tasked with the creation of an HTML email newsletter. As part of the project here are some of the things we had to tackle:

1. Establish good lines of communication with our project partners as we learn how to peer program and work remotely;
2. Learn how to use GitHub to establish proper use of version control;
3. Build our newsletter using HTML and CSS;
4. Understand the proper use of the `<table>` element and its children elements in the layout of the email newsletter;
5. Understand how to add inline CSS into the HTML so as to provide styling to the full structure;
6. Explore external resources to add extra pizzazz to our newsletter (Checkout the header at the opening of this README that was created using canva.com!); and
7. Test your code by viewing in the browser and also testing through different email platforms.

## Our Purpose

We aim to put all these skills together as we built our beautiful, holiday-inspired email newsletter. The goal was to put together a guide of some of the least known holiday events that take place in and around New York City.
