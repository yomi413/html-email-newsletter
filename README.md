# The Project

In this first project for Moms Can & Co. Cohort 5 we were tasked with the creation of an HTML email newsletter. As part of the project here are some of the things we had to tackle:

1. Establish good lines of communication with our project partners as we learn to peer program and work remotely.
2. Learn how to use GitHub to establish proper use of version control.
3. Build our newsletter using HTML and inline CSS.
4. Understand the proper use of the `<table>` element and its children elements in the layout of the email newsletter.
5. Understand how to add inline CSS into the HTML so as to provide styling to the full structure.
6. Explore external resources to add extra pizzazz to our newsletter. Checkout the header at the opening of this README that was created using <a href="https://www.canva.com/">canva.com</a>!
7. Test your code by viewing in the browser and also testing through different email platforms.

# Our Purpose

We aim to put all of these skills together as we build our beautiful, holiday-inspired email newsletter. The goal was to put together a guide of some of the lesser known holiday events that take place in and around New York City.

# Getting Started

You can interact with this newsletter by visiting <a href="http://yescano.com/html-email-newsletter/">http://yescano.com/html-email-newsletter/</a>. Feel free to scroll through the newsletter and click the active links. Additionally, each event image is clickable. Once clicked, you will be redirected to each event’s informational or web page.

# Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/yomi413/html-email-newsletter">https://github.com/yomi413/html-email-newsletter</a> by following these instructions carefully.

1. Open this repository <a href="https://github.com/yomi413/html-email-newsletter">https://github.com/yomi413/html-email-newsletter</a>.
2. Fork this repository to create your own copy.
3. Once forked, clone the repository onto your local environment by following these commands:
   1. In your terminal go to your working directory where you want this file to live.
   2. Once in your directory of choice type `git clone git@github.com:yomi413/html-email-newsletter.git`.

   4. Do not work directly in the master branch. Create a new branch for your work using `git checkout -b [name_of_you_new_branch]`.
   5. Open in your text editor of choice. I use VS Code.
   6. Once changes are made, commit your changes to your branch using the following commands:
   - `git add <file name>`
   - `git commit -m “[Brief but descriptive message]”`
   - `git push`
     At this point only the branch that lives in your version of the repository on GitHub has been updated.
   7. In GitHub, inside your version of the repository, click on `New Pull Request`.
   8. Choose the branches you want compared and submit a pull request to merge the files.
   9. When the pull request gets submitted the original owner of the repository will review changes and approve the request.
   10. Once approved, and if no conflict exists with master repository, changes will be merged and all files are up to date.
